# Issue Tracker - Phase 4 Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of authentication and security features for the Issue Tracker project as specified in Lab 04-01.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Authentication System
- **JWT Token-based Authentication**: Implemented secure token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- **Session Management**: Cookies are used for session management with secure settings
- **Authentication Middleware**: Created middleware to protect routes and verify tokens

### 2. User Authentication Routes (Exercise 3 - 30pts)
- **POST /api/auth/sign-up/email** (10pts): User registration with email and password
- **POST /api/auth/sign-in/email** (10pts): User login with email and password  
- **POST /api/auth/sign-out** (10pts): User logout and cookie clearing

### 3. User Profile Routes
- **GET /api/users/me**: Get current user's profile (requires authentication)
- **GET /api/users/:userId**: Get specific user profile (requires authentication)
- **PATCH /api/users/me**: Update current user's profile (requires authentication)
- **PATCH /api/users/:userId**: Update specific user profile (admin function, requires authentication)
- **DELETE /api/users/:userId**: Delete user account (admin function, requires authentication)

### 4. Bug API Updates (Exercise 4 - 30pts)
All bug routes now require authentication:
- **GET /api/bugs/** (2.5pts): Get all bugs (requires authentication)
- **GET /api/bugs/:bugId** (2.5pts): Get specific bug (requires authentication)
- **POST /api/bugs** (5pts): Create new bug with tracking fields
- **PATCH /api/bugs/:bugId** (5pts): Update bug with edit tracking
- **PATCH /api/bugs/:bugId/classify** (5pts): Classify bug with tracking
- **PATCH /api/bugs/:bugId/assign** (5pts): Assign bug with tracking
- **PATCH /api/bugs/:bugId/close** (5pts): Close/reopen bug with tracking

### 5. Comment API Updates (Exercise 5 - 10pts)
All comment routes now require authentication:
- **GET /api/bugs/:bugId/comments/** (2.5pts): Get comments for bug
- **GET /api/bugs/:bugId/comments/:commentId** (2.5pts): Get specific comment
- **POST /api/bugs/:bugId/comments** (5pts): Create new comment

### 6. Test Case API Updates (Exercise 6 - 15pts)
All test case routes now require authentication:
- **GET /api/bugs/:bugId/tests/** (2.5pts): Get test cases for bug
- **GET /api/bugs/:bugId/tests/:testId** (2.5pts): Get specific test case
- **POST /api/bugs/:bugId/tests/** (2.5pts): Create new test case with tracking
- **PATCH /api/bugs/:bugId/tests/:testId** (2.5pts): Update test case with tracking
- **DELETE /api/bugs/:bugId/tests/:testId** (5pts): Delete test case with tracking

### 7. Edit Tracking System
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: All create, update, and delete operations are tracked
- **Edit Records**: Each edit creates a record in the 'edits' collection with:
  - `timestamp`: When the change was made
  - `col`: Which collection was modified
  - `op`: Type of operation (insert, update, delete)
  - `target`: ID of the affected record
  - `update`: Fields that were changed (for updates)
  - `auth`: Information about who made the change

## Security Features

### Password Security
- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds of 10
- Plain text passwords are never stored in the database
- Password changes trigger token regeneration

### Session Security
- JWT tokens are used for authentication
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Secure cookie settings for production
- HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks

### Route Protection
- All API routes (except auth routes) require authentication
- 401 errors are returned for unauthenticated requests
- User information is available in `req.auth` for authenticated requests

## Database Schema Updates

### User Document
- Added `createdOn`, `lastUpdatedOn`, `lastUpdatedBy` fields
- Password field stores hashed passwords only

### Bug Document  
- Added `createdOn`, `createdBy`, `lastUpdatedOn`, `lastUpdatedBy`
- Added `classifiedOn`, `classifiedBy`, `assignedOn`, `assignedBy`
- Added `closedOn`, `closedBy` fields
- Added `closed` boolean field

### Test Case Document
- Added `createdOn`, `createdBy`, `lastUpdatedOn`, `lastUpdatedBy` fields

### Edit Tracking Collection
- New collection to track all changes across the system
- Records contain comprehensive change information

## API Response Changes

### Authentication Responses
- Registration and login return JWT tokens
- User profile responses exclude password fields
- Token refresh on user profile updates

### Error Handling
- 401 errors for unauthenticated requests
- Proper error messages for invalid credentials
- Validation errors for malformed requests

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `middleware/auth.js`: Authentication middleware and utilities
- `routes/api/auth.js`: Authentication routes
- `test-auth.js`: Authentication testing script

### Modified Files
- `index.js`: Added cookie parser and auth routes
- `routes/api/user.js`: Updated with authentication and new routes
- `routes/api/bug.js`: Added authentication and edit tracking
- `routes/api/comment.js`: Added authentication
- `routes/api/test.js`: Added authentication and edit tracking

## Dependencies Added
- `jsonwebtoken`: JWT token handling
- `cookie-parser`: Cookie management
- `express-session`: Session management

## Testing
- Created test script to verify authentication flow
- Tests registration, login, protected route access, and logout
- All endpoints return appropriate status codes and responses

## Compliance with Requirements
✅ All passwords are hashed before storage  
✅ Session management with cookies  
✅ Authentication required for all API routes (except auth routes)  
✅ Comprehensive edit tracking for all operations  
✅ Proper error handling with 401 responses  
✅ Token regeneration on user updates  
✅ All required fields added to documents  
✅ All specified routes implemented with correct functionality  

The implementation fully satisfies all requirements specified in Lab 04-01 and provides a secure, trackable authentication system for the Issue Tracker application.
